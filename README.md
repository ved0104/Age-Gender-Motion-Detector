# Age-Gender-Motion-Detector

This repository contains the tasks completed during the internship with NULLCLASS. The tasks involve building models for Age Detection, Gender-Age-Hair Identification, and Car Colour Detection. The models are implemented using deep learning techniques and are trained on relevant datasets.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. **Age Detection on IMDB-WIKI Dataset**
- **Description**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was trained to predict the age of individuals based on facial images.
- **Model Weights**: [Age Detection Model Weights](<Google Drive Link>)
  
### 2. **Gender-Age-Hair Identification**
- **Description**: A model to identify gender and predict age based on hair length, particularly for individuals aged 20-30.
- **Model Weights**: [Gender-Age-Hair Model Weights](<Google Drive Link>)
  
### 3. **Car Colour Detection in Traffic**
- **Description**: This task involves detecting car colors in traffic and counting vehicles and pedestrians at traffic signals.
- **Model Weights**: [Car Colour Detection Model Weights](<Google Drive Link>)

## Dataset Information

The datasets used for training the models are hosted on Google Drive:
- **Age Detection Dataset (IMDB-WIKI)**: [Google Drive Link](<Google Drive link>)
- **Car Colour Detection Dataset**: [Google Drive Link](<Google Drive link>)

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ved0104/Age-Gender-Motion-Detector.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the model weights from the provided Google Drive links and place them in the `models/` directory.

4. Run the respective Python scripts to train or evaluate the models.

## Usage

### Age Detection:
- You can run the `age_detection.py` script to train the Age Detection model or use the pretrained model for predictions.

### Gender-Age-Hair Identification:
- The `gender_age_hair.py` script allows you to train or test the Gender-Age-Hair model.

### Car Colour Detection:
- Use the `car_colour_detection.py` script for training or evaluating the Car Colour Detection model.
