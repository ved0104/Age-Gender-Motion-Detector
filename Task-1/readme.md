# Age Detection using CNN on the IMDB-WIKI Dataset

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for age detection using the IMDB-WIKI dataset. The CNN is trained to predict the age of a person from their image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed along with the required packages. Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

With these files, you have a complete project setup for training and evaluating an age detection model using CNNs on the IMDB-WIKI dataset. Adjust file paths and hyperparameters as needed based on your specific dataset and performance requirements.
